We took a wrong turn.

5 PM found us standing at the edge of a gravel railway track, discussing whether we should turn back to the highway or head onto the trail to find somewhere to camp. The shadows were getting longer and the air cooler, so we decided to head west on the railway line.

As we suited up to go, a dirt biker with a dark visor skidded towards us, glanced our direction, then continued on the road towards the direction from which we'd come. I thought for a minute. "That person looked like the size of a kid," I said. "A kid dirt biking." I said it more out of surprise than interest, and forgot about them as we set off down the trail.

After a few minutes I saw a rock cliff to the north lit up by the setting sun. Without hesitation I turned onto the dirt path towards it, which quickly entered an old quarry. In the distance I could see three figures on the side of the outcropping.

We got closer and eventually called out a greeting, leaving behind the bicycles and jogging up the hill to meet them. A.J., 14, sitting on a dirtbike eating candy. Abigail, 16, learning against a dirtbike with her hand on her helmet. Colin, 16, standing.

"You guys dirt bike?" I asked. A.J. laughed and gestured at the quarry below us. I turned to look. Among the rock and pools of water were dozens of well-worn trails and jumps. My eyes widened. "Who built all this?"

"We did," he replied with a mixture of insouciance and pride. "About thirty of us. We built it all."

They were as interested in us as we were in them, and we talked about bicycling across Canada ("That's absolutely cooked, man") and they talked about dirt biking after school ("Sometimes without the school, isn't it"). Eventually more teenagers came down from farther up the cliff, A.J. and Colin jumped to make tell the others that about us, and before we knew it we were down in the quarry shooting photographs.

This was a real place of juxtaposition. The bikers had a teenage-sanctioned devil-may-care bravado carried by cussing and Newfoundland slang, but it was clear in the work that had gone into building both the dirt bike track and a well-designed 'bough shack' in the woods that they really did care about that place and the time they spent in it.

"The last shack burnt to bits, thank Jesus it was winter time. Yeah we built this in a couple days." Shrug. Whatever. Except what they built really was extraordinary. They had places to sit, places to take in the view, places to leave their bikes.

It was young and old at the same time. The twelve year old didn't smoke because he ran races, but the rest of them did. They talked about run-ins with the cops, about drugs and sex and small-town freedoms. "You know, a skeet, someone who wears Adidas and
