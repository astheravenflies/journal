We woke up at 4 AM in Edmonton. That time of the day always reminds me of one of the most beautiful talks, [the Museum of 4 in the Morning](https://www.ted.com/talks/rives_a_museum_of_4_o_clock_in_the_morning). We were driven to the airport by a man named Faisal who'd lost his job due to the oil recession a year ago.

We parted ways with [our friend Ruth](news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/three-young-indigenous-women-honoured-as-everyday-political-citizens-by-samara-canada) and hopped on the plane just as they were making the final boarding call. Cutting it close.

We had a 12 hour layover in Toronto and spent the time using what we suspect might be the last time we've got high-speed internet for a little while. We also finishing packing 14 tiny boxes worth of supplies filled with journals, energy bars, electrolytes, 35mm film, and a few other knick-knacks. (We've got a lot of knick-knacks and before too long, they might make an appearance over the side of cliffs/highways/fences.) 

We walked around the arboretum right beside my sister's residence which is where we'd decided to spend our layover. She's the middleman/middlewoman between getting our boxes shipped out to us across the country over the next six months.

We're thrilled (and at least for the first part, chilled) to find out.
