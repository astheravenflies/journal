We called Calvin and he offered to meet us on the Trans-Canada Highway at an upcoming gas-station restaurant. "Better put your jackets on," he remarked on the phone. "I can see the rain coming across the water. It's coming with the wind."

<blockquote>But from my perspective I'm not about to celebrate the 150th, Canada hasn't been that good to my people. So I don't feel like celebrating to me it's not a celebration.</blockquote> 

<blockquote>That would be one thing to celebrate, we can celebrate our survival. Of colonialism taking over, we can survive that, because we have survived that and its been a struggle and certainly nothing to celebrate. There is a real ignorance in society when it comes to a lot of the darker chapters of Canadian history. Especially the chapters that deal with the First Nations people.</blockquote>

>>First Nations, Not Indian

<blockquote>I never call myself an Indian, Indians are people who come from India.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I'm a First Nations person, I'm an Aboriginal person.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We were brought into Canada.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I was raised in an isolated community and having lived in an isolated community there were advantages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The bureaucracy and the authorities never imposed themself on our community because we were out of sight, out of mind, and certainly, out of reach.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I grew up practicing the traditional way of life, hunting and fishing and living off the land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We were already feeling the effects of forced assimilation or the intent to impose assimilation upon people. We were being eroded of our culture, our land was being stolen away from us, our language was taken away from us</blockquote>

<blockquote>I don't have to tell you about the atrocities of the residential schools. I'm sure you've been exposed to that and have some knowledge of that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That oppression was reaching my community so that's what inspired me to take up the challenge of Aboriginal causes and get involved.</blockquote>

>>Growing Up On Caviar

<blockquote>When you're a 10-year-old boy, if you can take the shovel and go down on the beach, and dig a bucket of clams and come home and have that for supper. How can anybody look at you and say you're in poverty and you need to get out of that poverty?</blockquote>

>>Savages on the West Coast

<blockquote>Traveling Europeans ... mostly on fishing expeditions ... because of the connection that they made with our people ... they included them in a lot of their notes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All kinds of references mentioning our people ... it talked about the Mi’kmaq people of bay of St. George, it talked about the savages on the West Coast of Newfoundland, it talked about the jackie tars ... which was a derogatory term that was given to people who were lesser than other people.</blockquote>

>>Fishing Industry in Newfoundland

<iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323792465&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<blockquote>Instead of Aboriginal people being integrated into colonial society or colonial thinking, it was the opposite. Rural Newfoundlanders survived because they adopted an Aboriginal way of life. That's why rural Newfoundland was so thriving and made such a contribution to the building of the capitalism that we now have serving us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Built on the backs of Newfoundland fisherman: Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal. People who got up at 4 o'clock in the morning and risked their lives to bring money in that ended up with the merchants of St. John's.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So the relationship was phenomenal, it was an excellent relationship.  We needed their money or we needed their shoes or we needed their clothing. My grandmother used to carry berries to Sandy Point and she wouldn't come back with cash, she'd come back with a backload of clothes that she could cut over for children, for her grandchildren.</blockquote>

>>The Decision

<blockquote>I'm going to travel around Newfoundland and organize Aboriginal people because we've been denied, we've been lied to, we've been discriminated against, just been racism that we grew up with and I'm not going to tolerate it anymore. I'm going to challenge the bureaucracy.</blockquote>

>>Indigenous Culture

<blockquote>Culture is not smoking a pipe or using sweetgrass or smudging, that's only one. That is the spiritual aspect of culture. Culture is holistic, it's how you live, it's the things you eat, the knowledge of how you prepare food, how do you relate to your neighbour, how do you relate to your family, that's what culture is.</blockquote>

>>Preservation

<blockquote>As important as our education system is, our education system fails to teach us about preservation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We lose all sight of responsibility to the future generations and that's the battle, that's the struggle, that's the struggle to try to convince people that there are certain things we need to hang on to, we need to keep intact, there are values we need.</blockquote>

>>The Next 150 Years

<iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323792506&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<blockquote>I don't hold these people  responsible for what their forefathers done, I don't hold anybody in government responsible for what their forefathers done to our people, I hold them responsible for what they fail to do now.</blockquote>

<blockquote>What are we going to do in the next 150 years with our Aboriginal people. We're not going to celebrate the last 150 because we don't have anything to celebrate, what we have is a trail of broken promises.</blockquote>

>>How Culture Survives

<iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323792510&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<blockquote>Culture survives because it embraces not because it overpowers.</blockquote>

>>Shared Knowledge

<iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323792523&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<blockquote>This was another teaching of my grandfather is that knowledge that are withheld is of no value, knowledge is meant to be shared ... now having said that, don't ask me about my favourite fishing hole because I'm not going to tell you that's not knowledge. Knowledge is how big are the fish there.</blockquote>

>>Responsibility of Storytelling

<iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323792534&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<blockquote>That's part of my responsibility like I don't know you, I don't know what your project is about, I don't know who you were ... if one other person or if nobody else hears my story, two more people have heard it and that is how change happens.</blockquote>
