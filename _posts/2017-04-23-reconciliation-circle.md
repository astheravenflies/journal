We spent most of yesterday at a Reconciliation Circle facilitated by 3 Things Consulting, <a href="https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/culture-history/history/engage-for-change">number three of ten</a> such activities put on by the City of Kingston. 

Two spots had opened up last minute and it was the type of event that was a priority for us to attend even with all the packing, cleaning, organizing, and loading left to do before we rolled out of town.

I walked into the room to check-in, signed the media release form and took my place in the large circle. We got started soon and the opening remarks from Pytor, on how an elder stays with us throughout the event and not just for the opening and closing resonated strongly. 

We smudged outside, led by Elder Bernard, using tobacco which had been grown in the neighboring Mohawk First Nation Tyendinaga.

Learned of the different relationships attendees had that led them into the room such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Row_Wampum_Treaty">Two Row Wampum</a>. Two different people walking/rowing their own parallel ways with peace, friendship, and love as the common waters.

It wasn't just a wonderful event for the programming but for the details in the programming such as the food which was provided by an Indigenous catering company.

It was a mix of tremendous sadness and moments of humour and how did we get here and where do we go from here, and yes, of corse, we will go together because that is the only way forward for us.

There was an impressive Inuk teenager who taught us a little of the Inuit ways and lit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudlik">Kudlik</a>.

Towards the end of it all, we received two medicine bags (tobacco, sweetgrass, sage, cedar, and juniper) and were sent on our way with prayers.

We're headed east to west and could use all the tailwinds we can muster. This gathering certainly provided lots of it.
