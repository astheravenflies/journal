It was a s-l-o-w start to the morning, which began with an elaborate breakfast and then walking the dog. It is one of the most magical parts of a trip like this, how you can slip into someone else's day. Our host has two rambunctious cats who like to explore all the nooks and crannies that they can get into.

We were headed out to Twilingate to try and talk to some locals, ideally a fisherman and we stumbled across the perfect people. More on that in later posts.
