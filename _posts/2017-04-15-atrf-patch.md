We've got a limited amount of As The Raven Flies patches left having shipped out all the ones for our backers earlier this week. 

We've got strong opinions about logos which Jonathon has <a href="https://notes.chairsandtables.org/why-i-cover-up-corporate-logos-6cd011d2fa36">written about before</a>. The naming of this project was in and of itself its own feat. The expression "As the crow flies" is a common one. We chose the 'raven' for the symbolism and its presence in multiple indigenous lore.

We aren't going to be printing anymore of these, so if you missed out on supporting the campaign or just wanted this beautiful patch, <a href="https://gum.co/LOsKN">order one</a>!
