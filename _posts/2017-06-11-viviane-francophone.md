"It had been my lifelong dream to study at the University of New Brunswick," Viviane said. "I knew that's what I wanted to do."

Viviane's high school was a French convent, which I unfortunately don't know any more about because the story really begins in the lineup for the registrar at the start of the 1959 fall semester at the University of New Brunswick. She had her acceptance letter in her hand and the money she needed to pay for tuition in her pocket. This was the start of a new part of her life.

And then she was told that it wasn't.

The registrar looked at her letter, at her secondary school and French last name, looked back at her and said, "You can't be here. You're French." She said there must have been a mistake and told Viviane politely but firmly to leave both the lineup and the university.

Perhaps I can't really imagine the panic of the situation, but I'm close enough to that age that I can feel some of it. 18 years old, wide eyes, heart pumping. Wanting to cry but trying to hold it back. Wanting to run straight back home where I know where I belong. I'm extrapolating my own feelings onto Viviane's experience, of course, but I can imagine it. As if the first day of university wasn't stressful enough.

She ended up convincing another administrator to let her pay tuition. Her entire claim to placement in the university came down to a single receipt.

"I didn't know what to do." Viviane told us, "I knew which courses I wanted to take, but I couldn't register for any course because I didn't have that piece of paper signed by the registrar. Courses started. I started going to them." Professors noticed that she wasn't on the list, but assumed there must have been a clerical error. Nothing was computerized back then, so there could easily have been a mistake. She kept attending classes and at the end of the semester passed all of them, all the while fearing and expecting that any moment she would be discovered and expelled.

"In October, in the math class, a secretary knocks at the door and she has a letter for the prof, and I know it's for me. I just know it's a letter for me. I was shaking. As soon as class is over I duck in the bathroom, and I open the letter and it's from the dean. The dean wants to see me."

She went to the dean's office, with no doubt in her mind that she was about to be expelled. The dean, however, commented that with French-speaking soldiers moving to Gagetown from Qu√©bec the university needed to spruce up its French language instruction. 

"He said, 'We were wondering if you would like to teach a course.'"

That was the bombshell of the story. For the next three-and-a-half years, Viviane taught in the French department, and was never admitted to the university. Even to the day of her graduation she was afraid she'd get caught. She eventually founded the Second Language Research Institute of Canada in 1987, an internationally recognized, publically funded organization that is still based out of the University of New Brunswick; and was named professor emeritus upon her retirement.

There's a lot of things you can take from this story. You can relate it to the long history of anti-French discrimination in Atlantic Canada and sexism in post-secondary school education. You can admire the pluck and resilience of a young woman facing those issues entirely on her own. You can smile at the thought of Viviane being named professor emeritus by the very university that tried to turn her away. You can take all of those things and more. 

The takeaway for me is that our history is alive, and our past is not as far away as we would often like to believe. This was a story full of laughter, but it was still a story of discrimination. I wonder what stories like it are happening today. Who are we turning away today, through acts of racism, classism and sexism? Who is being denied entry into our borders and our institutions, and might they hold the same potential that Viviane did in 1959?
