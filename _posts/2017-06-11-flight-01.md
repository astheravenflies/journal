The moment you've all been waiting for, the first episode of our podcast. Will be producing these for each dispatch. 

This episode is a hodge podge of clips from the road, a cultural museum's retired-teacher-turned-fisherman captain, a former machinist talking about his love for Montreal Canadiens, an environmental historian about the rules in historical thinking, a love story on the ferry, the tale of a lobster fisherman, a young Mik'maq musician on Canada, a Syrian family talking about Canada, Jonathon surviving an assassination attempt, and harmonicas. All in less than 8 minutes!

Incredible, I know, and we're only getting started. Enjoy.
