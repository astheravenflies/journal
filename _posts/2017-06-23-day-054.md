We rolled out a little s-l-o-w, I'm not entirely sure why but I think we perhaps suspected a little deeper than we knew how long the day would be.

We had a call with our terrific bicycle sponsors, Vanhawks, and Jonathon zoomed away while I ran into someone who started their trip from St. John's almost two weeks after us. Harold Earle of Earle Industries had told him about us! His son flew in from Vancouver to Quebec City to cycle tour till Ottawa with his dad. Neat-o.
